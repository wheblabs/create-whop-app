### Using the Whop SDK

The Whop SDK is initialized in `src/lib/whop.ts` and available throughout your app:

// Make API requests
const user = await whopSdk.users.getUser({ userId: 'user_123' })
```

### Using Whop Context

Access Whop data in your components using the Whop context:

```typescript
'use client'
import { useWhopUser } from '@/components/whop-context'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { user } = useWhopUser()

  return <div>Hello {user.username}!</div>
}
```
