# create-whop-app

The fastest way to create a [Whop](https://whop.com) app with authentication, app credentials, and optional database setup - all configured automatically.

```bash
npx create-whop-app@latest
# or
pnpm dlx create-whop-app@latest
# or
bunx create-whop-app@latest
# or
yarn create whop-app
```

## Features

- Automated Whop authentication with OTP
- Creates and installs app in one command
